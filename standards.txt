Site Goals:
  - Primary
   - Exam papers questions animated
    - Interactive widgets; tangeable, dymanic learning
  - Secondary
    - LC concepts animated
    - Concepts explained
Avoid:
  - Complete maths course
  - Tutoring, video lessons
  - Static route learning

Site Niche:
  Self paced, minimalistic learning
  Visual explanations
  Everything you need for an exam question in one page


Animation Standards
 - First frame static
 - Colour variables, change colour for different indices
 - Match function colours with graph colours
 - Animate one term at a time
 - Dont change term position and value at once

Definitions Standards
  - Source from wikipedia, simply for LC context

Step list Standards
  - single statement for title, with no full stop
  - puncuation in text

Topics
  - Statistics and Probability
  - Geometry
    - Areas volumes, angles, theroms
  - Trigonomatry
  - Graphs (Co-ordinate geometry)
  - Functions
  - Number Systems
  - Factorisation
  - Inequalities
  - Complex Numbers

  - Indices
  - Surds
  - Logarithims

  - Derivation
      xy    => x'y + y'x
      x/y   => x'y + y'x / y^2
      3x    =>  3
      3x^5  =>  15px^4
      e^x   => e^x
      e^3x  =>  3e^3x
      3^x   =>  3^x ln3
      sinx  =>  cosx
      cosx  => -sinx
      tanx  => sec^2(x)
      ln(x)  =>  1/x
      logb(x)  => 1/xlnb
